We use cookies, which are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded on your device, or related technologies, such as web beacons, local shared objects and tracking pixels to store or collect information. For additional information about cookies and related technologies, including details of how to opt out, please go to our Cookies Notice (https://adrx.com/company/cookie-policy).

                Information We Collect from Other Sources. We may collect personal information about you from others, such as:

                Third-Party Sources. Examples of third-party sources include marketers, technology partners like researchers, affiliates (like companies under common ownership or control of ADRX), service providers, and others where they are legally allowed to share your personal information with us. For example, if you register for our Services on another website, the website may provide your personal information to us.

                Other Customers. Other customers may give us your personal information. For example, if a customer wants you to sign an electronic document in our Services, he or she will give us your email address and name.

                Combining Personal Information from Different Sources. We may combine the personal information we receive from other sources with personal information we collect from you (or your device) and use it as described in this Privacy Policy.

                Personal Information We Collect & Process on Behalf of Customers. When our business customers use certain Services, we generally process and store certain personal information on their behalf as a data processor. For example, in ADRX Signature when a customer uploads contracts or other documents for review or signature, we act as a data processor and process the documents on the customers behalf and in accordance with their instructions. In those instances, the customer is the data controller and is responsible for most aspects of the processing of the personal information. If you have any questions or concerns about how personal information is processed in these cases, including how to exercise your rights as a data subject, you should contact the customer (either your employer or the individual requesting your signature). If we receive any rights requests concerning instances where we act as data processor, we will forward your query on to the relevant customer.

                We collect your personal information to provide and improve our Services and to support advertising and marketing. See Section 2 Use of Personal Information for additional information.

                We may share your personal information with third parties as provided in Section 3 Personal Information Sharing.

We may combine the personal information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of personal information (“de-identify”) to limit or prevent identification of any particular user or device to help with goals like research and marketing. Once such information has been aggregated and anonymized so that it is no longer considered personal information under data protection law, this Privacy Notice does not apply.

                    Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Information. If European data protection law applies and where ADRX acts as a data controller, our lawful basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect or use it.

                    We normally collect or use personal information from you or others only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect or retain personal information or may need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, when we:

                    Use personal information to create and manage an account, we do so to provide you with relevant Services and perform our contract with you.

                    Gather and record data associated with use of a digital certificate or digital signature, it is to comply with regulations.

                    Use names and email addresses for email marketing purposes, we do so with your consent (which you can withdraw at any time) or where permitted under applicable law, on the basis of our legitimate interests.

                    Gather usage data and analyze it to improve our Services or ensure the security of our websites for example, we do so based on our legitimate interest in safeguarding and improving our Services.

                    If you have questions about or need further information concerning the lawful basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided in Section ­­10 of this Privacy Policy.  Note in situations where ADRX acts as a processor, it is our customer who determines the appropriate legal basis and queries should be directed to them.
